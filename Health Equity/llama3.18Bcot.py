    Follow these structured steps for reasoning:

    1. **Focus on Disenfranchised Individuals/Populations:**
    - Does the study intentionally include or focus on disenfranchised populations? Disenfranchised populations include:
        * BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), including Hispanic/Latino/a/x individuals.
        * LGBTQ+, gender diverse, or transgender individuals.
        * Individuals with disabilities or intellectual/developmental delays.
        * Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups (e.g., poverty, food insecurity, lack of healthcare access).
        * Individuals who speak a language other than English.
        * Populations receiving care in underserved settings (e.g., rural areas, Federally Qualified Health Centers, community hospitals, Title 1 schools, or low-and-middle-income countries).
        * Groups disproportionately affected by specific conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease, malaria, HIV).
        * Women (to consider sex differences) are also regarded as disenfranchised individuals in this context.
    - Does the study explore health disparities, inequities, or differences in health outcomes based on these identities?

    2. **Study Context or Setting:**
    - Does the study involve underserved or resource-limited settings? Examples include:
        * Rural areas in the U.S. or the Global South.
        * Community hospitals, juvenile justice centers, or Title 1 schools.
    - Does the study focus on health conditions overwhelmingly concentrated in disenfranchised populations?

    3. **Examination of Discrimination or Oppression:**
    - Does the study explicitly explore the impact of racism, sexism, ableism, xenophobia, or other forms of discrimination or oppression?
    - Does it examine strategies to reduce bias, harm, or inequities (e.g., training programs for providers to improve interactions with marginalized populations)?

    4. **Research Methods or Equity Focus:**
    - Does the study use methods or strategies to increase equitable engagement or access among disenfranchised groups? Examples include:
        * Community-based participatory research.
        * Inclusion of culturally or linguistically adapted tools (e.g., non-English surveys).
        * Descriptions of experiences in underserved or resource-limited settings.

    5. **Additional Considerations:**
    - Age of participants is not a criterion for determining health equity scholarship.
    - Physical health interventions targeting specific health conditions are not considered part of health equity unless they address systemic inequities or disparities.

    6. **Final Evaluation:**
    - If the study meets any of the above criteria, it qualifies as health equity scholarship.
    - If ambiguity or partial focus exists, classify the study as 'Yes' to avoid missing relevant work.

        "abstract": "Predicting long-term kidney allograft failure is an unmet need for clinical care and clinical trial optimization in children. We aimed to validate a kidney allograft failure risk prediction system in a large international cohort of pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Patients from 20 centers in Europe and the United States, transplanted between 2004 and 2017, were included. Allograft assessment included estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, circulating antihuman leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibody, and kidney allograft histology. Individual predictions of allograft failure were calculated using the integrative box (iBox) system. Prediction performances were assessed using discrimination and calibration. The allograft evaluations were performed in 706 kidney transplant recipients at a median time of 9.1 (interquartile range, 3.3-19.2) months posttransplant; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 68.7 Â± 28.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, and median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 0.1 (0.0-0.4) g/g, and 134 (19.0%) patients had antihuman leukocyte antigen donor-specific antibodies. The iBox exhibited accurate calibration and discrimination for predicting the outcomes up to 10 years after evaluation, with a C-index of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.87). This study confirms the generalizability of the iBox to predict long-term kidney allograft failure in children, with performances similar to those reported in adults. These results support the use of the iBox to improve patient monitoring and facilitate clinical trials in children.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Kidney failure is a rare but serious late effect following treatment for childhood cancer. We developed a model using demographic and treatment characteristics to predict individual risk of kidney failure among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer. Methods: Five-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without history of kidney failure (n = 25,483) were assessed for subsequent kidney failure (ie, dialysis, kidney transplantation, or kidney-related death) by age 40 years. Outcomes were identified by self-report and linkage with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and the National Death Index. A sibling cohort (n = 5,045) served as a comparator. Piecewise exponential models accounting for race/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, nephrectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, congenital genitourinary anomalies, and early-onset hypertension estimated the relationships between potential predictors and kidney failure, using area under the curve (AUC) and concordance (C) statistic to evaluate predictive power. Regression coefficient estimates were converted to integer risk scores. The St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study and the National Wilms Tumor Study served as validation cohorts. Results: Among CCSS survivors, 204 developed late kidney failure. Prediction models achieved an AUC of 0.65-0.67 and a C-statistic of 0.68-0.69 for kidney failure by age 40 years. Validation cohort AUC and C-statistics were 0.88/0.88 for the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (n = 8) and 0.67/0.64 for the National Wilms Tumor Study (n = 91). Risk scores were collapsed to form statistically distinct low- (n = 17,762), moderate- (n = 3,784), and high-risk (n = 716) groups, corresponding to cumulative incidences in CCSS of kidney failure by age 40 years of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7), 2.1% (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.9), and 7.5% (95% CI, 4.3 to 11.6), respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1 to 0.5) among siblings. Conclusion: Prediction models accurately identify childhood cancer survivors at low, moderate, and high risk for late kidney failure and may inform screening and interventional strategies.",

To help fill this gap, we performed a retrospective study using plasma and serum samples from 183 SGM enrolled at the Lagos site of the TRUST/RV368 cohort in Nigeria, assayed them for HSV-2 antibodies with the Kalon ELISA and plasma cytokines and chemokines with Luminex, and correlated the findings with HIV-1 viral loads (VLs) and CD4 counts. We found an overall HSV-2 prevalence of 36.6% (49.5% and 23.9% among SGM with and without HIV-1, respectively, p< .001). Moreover, HSV-2-positive status was associated with high circulating concentrations of CCL11 among antiretroviral therapy-treated (p= .031) and untreated (p= .015) participants, and with high concentrations of CCL2 in the untreated group (p= .004), independent of VL. Principal component analysis revealed a strong association of cytokines with HIV-1 VL independent of HSV-2 status. In conclusion, our study finds that HSV-2 prevalence among SGM with HIV-1 is twice as high than HSV-2 prevalence among SGM without HIV-1 in Lagos and suggests that this is associated with higher levels of certain systemic cytokines. Additional work is needed to further characterize the relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in SGM and help develop targeted therapies for coinfected individuals.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Race and ethnicity are social constructs that are associated with meaningful health inequities. To address health disparities, it is essential to have valid, reliable race and ethnicity data. We compared child race and ethnicity as identified by the parent with that reported in the electronic health record (EHR). Methods: A convenience sample of parents of pediatric emergency department (PED) patients completed a tablet-based questionnaire (February-May 2021). Parents identified their child's race and ethnicity from options within a single category. We used chi-square to compare concordance between child race and ethnicity reported by the parent with that recorded in the EHR. Results: Of 219 approached parents, 206 (94%) completed questionnaires. Race and/or ethnicity were misidentified in the EHR for 56 children (27%). Misidentifications were most common among children whose parents identified them as multiracial (100% vs 15% of children identified as a single race, P < 0.001) or Hispanic (84% vs 17% of non-Hispanic children, P < 0.001), and children whose race and/or ethnicity differed from that of their parent (79% vs 18% of children with the same race and ethnicity as their parent, P < 0.001).

        "abstract": "Background: Residential segregation is an important factor that negatively impacts cancer disparities, yet studies yield mixed results and complicate clear recommendations for policy change and public health intervention. In this study, we examined the relationship between local and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) measures of Black isolation (segregation) and survival among older non-Hispanic (NH) Black women with breast cancer (BC) in the United States. We hypothesized that the influence of local isolation on mortality varies based on MSA isolation-specifically, that high local isolation may be protective in the context of highly segregated MSAs, as ethnic density may offer opportunities for social support and buffer racialized groups from the harmful influences of racism. Methods: Local and MSA measures of isolation were linked by Census Tract (CT) with a SEER-Medicare cohort of 5,231 NH Black women aged 66-90 years with an initial diagnosis of stage I-IV BC in 2007-2013 with follow-up through 2018. Proportional and cause-specific hazards models and estimated marginal means were used to examine the relationship between local and MSA isolation and all-cause and BC-specific mortality, accounting for covariates (age, comorbidities, tumor stage, and hormone receptor status). Findings: Of 2,599 NH Black women who died, 40.0% died from BC. Women experienced increased risk for all-cause mortality when living in either high local (HR = 1.20; CI = 1.08-1.33; p < 0.001) or high MSA isolation (HR = 1.40; CI = 1.17-1.67; p < 0.001). A similar trend existed for BC-specific mortality. Pairwise comparisons for all-cause mortality models showed that high local isolation was hazardous in less isolated MSAs but was not significant in more isolated MSAs. Interpretation: Both local and MSA isolation are independently associated with poorer overall and BC-specific survival for older NH Black women. However, the impact of local isolation on survival appears to depend on the metropolitan area's level of segregation. Specifically, in highly segregated MSAs, living in an area with high local isolation is not significantly associated with poorer survival. While the reasons for this are not ascertained in this study, it is possible that the protective qualities of ethnic density (e.g., social support and buffering from experiences of racism) may have a greater role in more segregated MSAs, serving as a counterpart to the hazardous qualities of local isolation. More research is needed to fully understand these complex relationships. Funding: National Cancer Institute.",
